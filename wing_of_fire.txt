beatiful hands are those that do the work 
that is earnest,brave and true
moment by moment
The long day through


for all your days prepare
And meet them ever alike
When you are anvil,bear-
When you are hammer,strike

Between the conception
and the creation
Between the emotion
And the response
Falls the shadow

Dont worry and fret,fainthearted
The chances have just begun,
For the best jobs haven't been started
The best work hasn't been done
